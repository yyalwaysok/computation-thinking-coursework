            <h1>Computational Thinking</h1>
            <p>Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible
                solutions. We can then present these solutions in away that a computer, a human, or both, can understand.

                    <p>In April 1960, China’s first home-grown electronic digital general purpose computer – the Model 107 –
                        went
                        live. Xia Peisu, the machine’s engineer and designer, had just made history.

                        After decades of war with Japan and the Chinese Civil War in the first half of the 20th Century, the
                        country’s technological innovation had fallen behind much of the developed world. Later, caught in the
                        politics of the Cold War, the newly established People’s Republic of China was cut off from aid and
                        exports from capitalist nations in the West. Chinese scientists relied heavily on hardware and expertise
                        from
                        the Soviet Union to build up their computing power.

                    <p>
                        But when that relationship dissolved in 1959, China was once again isolated and it had to look inward
                        for a way forward in an increasingly computerised world. Within a year of the Soviet Union withdrawing
                        aid, Xia delivered the 107 – China’s first step on the road to independence in computing.

                        Today, China is a global leader in computer production. In 2011, China surpassed the US to become the
                        world’s leading market for PCs, and the desktop PC segment of their computer industry alone is projected
                        to bring in a revenue of over $6.4bn (£4.9bn) this year.

                    <p>
                        But there was more work to be done than making computers. To build a new computer industry – and a new
                        field of computer science to support that industry – China needed trained personnel. Here, too, Xia was
                        essential.

                        She helped shape some of China’s first computing and computer science institutions and developed their
                        training materials. She taught the first computer theory class in the country. Over her career, she
                        would usher hundreds of students into the country’s burgeoning field of computer science.

                        In the aftermath of war and political upheaval, Xia shaped a new field of science and a new industry in
                        China. Through both her technological innovations and the many students she taught, Xia‘s influence
                        resonates throughout China’s computing world today.</p>
